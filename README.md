For now I have three different parameterizations to test the system:
- Original MMCs
- Regular rectangles
- Capsules (rectangles with a circular cap)

# TO-DO
- Write a proper readme
- Make use of the defined domain everywhere instead of hardcoding values
- Make a logging system that logs all settings/state of the procedure
- Add live plotting again
- Make into python package
- Implement the geo from mask to see how discrete will do
- Adding the notebooks with example calculations
